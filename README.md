We took the "[INFOUE] Usability Engineering & User Experience" course at Utrecht University. Our research question was whether Fitts' Law could be accurately modeled using touch input data. The final report can be found in this repository after the course ends and if we have confirmed that next year's course won't contain a similar assignment. 

This GitHub Readme.md is essentially the Supplementary Online Material and it contains the source code for the software/applet that was used in the experiment.
